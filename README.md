# LET'S GET STARTED

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

After unzipping this folder, copy and paste it into this directory [`C:\xampp\htdocs`] or the directory where you installed xampp server and place it in htdocs.

Run xampp control panel and start MySQL and Apache.

Click this link [`http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php?route=/server/privileges&adduser=1`](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php?route=/server/privileges&adduser=1) to add a user so that you have DATABASE USERNAME AND A DATABASE PASSWORD, go ahead and also create your database and create two tables, [`user`] and [`contacts`] as I have used these tables in my code.

Then open the [config.php] file located in [`config/constants.php`]

Kindly modify the [Folder Structure] and the [UI] of the website to fit your needs to avoid plagiarism and change names of files and folders and tables for convenience.

In case you run into a problem contact me ASAP!!!
